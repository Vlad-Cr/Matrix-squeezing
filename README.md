# Matrix-squeezing
## I developed a matrix squeezing algorithm to save memory using C++

I developed matrix squeezing algorithm to compress a matrix that has more than 70% zero data. Also I make manipulations with squeezed matrix, 
I place the smallest elements in a column on a diagonal. This algorithm helps save memory, because you don't need store zero data.

My project has MatrixSqueezing.cpp file that contains the code.
